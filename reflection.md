## What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that there are a few different ways to achieve the same positioning desire using padding and margins together. I found that borders are a really handy tool in visualizing where elements are falling, and what their padding and margins are at any given time. Turning orders on (EVERYTHING!) is the most basic trick I have been using to help work through positioning at the moment. 

## What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned that it is extremely tricky and takes a lot of trial and error to get right. I learned that different media display pages differently, so even when I was satisfied with my CSS positioning on my laptop, I should have checked it out on my mobile phone, as well as on my large desk-monitors.


## What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
For me, positioning was the most difficult concept to grasp thus far at DBC. I spent a lot of time this week trying to get my index.html page right, and still am not 100% happy with it. It was especially difficult to get the main (non-header and non-footer) content to position across the page in the way I wanted. I read about equal height column tricks and techniques like the Faux Method, but eventually used a more basic padding method to get the effect I was hoping for.


## What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Adding elements happens in html as I understand it, so not related to CSS.
As for formatting, I learned everything from basic element constructs (margin, padding, and border) to font alignment and font families, to display and positioning options. I experimented a lot with static/relative/absolute/fixed positioning, and also with inline/inline-block display options to see and try to figure out the result of each combination and permutation.
