    <h1>Phase 0 End Reflection</h1>

        It has been a great experience building a personal website during phase-0. One of the frustrations I have had in my career has been the inability to be able to point to something tangible at the end of a project which very often only ended in a report that was shelved away and forgotten. It therefore feels great to be able to share a link with friends and family and show them what I have been up to these past 8 weeks.

        It was sometimes challenging to overcome the fear of writing about a topic in a blog that I had only just learned myself, and that I knew I my knowledge was barely scratching the surface. Nevertheless, this process was tremendously helpful in solidifying what I had learned, especially since we were asked to put down our reflections in newbie terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the final touch-up of phase-0, I went through my index pages, blog pages, and contact page correcting the little formatting and mismatched layout items that had always been bugging me but that I was never able to get around to before. I am happy with where the website stands at the end of phase-0 and look forward to receiving and incorporating feedback going forward.
