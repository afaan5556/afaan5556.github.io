    <h1>Visa Applications | Why Are They Still So Onerous?</h1>
    <h2>Using Ruby Classes</h2>
    <h4>February 27, 2016</h4>
  
    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        I had an unplanned family related trip home come up recently, and for reasons only worth getting into over a beer, I had to apply for a Pakistani visa. I have had my fair share of visa application and process nightmares, but this time I stopped and wondered why it was still, in this day and age, such an amazingly onerous process. We have all joked about how Foot Locker manages to maintain all our details on file, but we still have to fill in a from on a clip-board in the ER, and this experience brought on similar thoughts. However, this time I couldn't help also think about how simple this data gathering, crunching, and returning effort could actually be using what we learned this week: <strong>Ruby Classes</strong>    
      </p>
      <h3>What is a Ruby Class?</h3>
      <p>
        Ruby is an object oriented language. This basically means two things:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>All elements (such as arrays, strings, hashes) are objects</li>
         <li>All objects are instances of a Class of that object type</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The following diagram illustrates this concept</p>
      <img src="imgs/class_chain.jpg">
      <p>
        The first example above may seem trivial, but when it comes to classes, it is actually useful to think of a 1.8T model as a specific kind of VolksWagen Jetta, and a VolksWagen Jetta as a specific kind of car. You could take this one step (or any number of steps) further to say that a car is a specific kind of vehicle.   
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same way, an integer is an object of the class "Fixnum," which in turn is a subclass of the class "Integer." (In this example the Integer class is also known as the "superclass" of the Fixnum class) Taking this one step further like we did for the car example, the Integer class is a subclass of the "Numeric" class (which is in turn the superclass of the Integer class)
      </p>
      <p>Based on these principals, the code snippet below can be used to set up a basic visa_application class.</p>

        <code>
          <div id="html">
            class visa_application<br>
              def initialize(application_number)<br>
              @application_number = application_number<br>
              end<br>
              end<br>
          </div>
        </code>
        <p>The code above is declaring a class of the type "visa_application" and it is <i>initializing</i> it with an application number (a unique number that is associated with each unique visa applications). That all makes sense, but what is the "@applciation_number" all about? The answer is "instance variables."</p>
        <h3>Instance Variables</h3>
        <p>Just like in the integer and Jetta examples above, each unique visa application is going to be an <i>instance</i> of the class "visa_application." Object and instance are used somewhat interchangeably and mean the same thing in this context.</p>
        <p>The class needs a way to allow all visa applications to have an application number, but also make sure that each unique application (or instance of the class) has its own unique application number that is accessible within that particular instance. This is exactly what is achieved through the instance variable declaration in the code above (instance variables are preceded by the "@" symbol.)
        </p>
        <h3>Instance Methods</h3>
        <p>It's great that our visa_application class now allows us to create new instances of the visa_application class (or simply put, unique visa applications) but that's all it does so far. What if we wanted the class to also generate and manipulate some information pertaining to the particular application in question? This is where instance methods come in to play.
        </p>
        <p>The code below shows how the visa_application class could be supplemented with an <i>"instance method"</i> called "visa_duration". The intent of this method would be to return the visa duration (in this example, the first 2 digits of the visa application number, in months) when called as a method on <i>any</i> instance of the visa_application class.</p>
        <code>
          <div id="html">
            class visa_application<br>
              def initialize(application_number)<br>
              @application_number = application_number<br>
              end<br>
              <br>
              def visa_duration<br>
              @application_number.to_s.slice(0..1)<br>
              end<br>
              <br>
              end<br>
          </div>
        </code>
        <p>Notice how the instance variable @application_number is used inside the visa_duration method. This works because <i>each instance</i> of the visa_application class has access to it's own instance of this application number, and to the subsequent instance methods that are called on it.</p>

      <h3>Creating Class Instances and Calling Instance Methods</h3>
      <p>We now have a class that can be used to generate visa applications, and we can call a method on any generated visa application to figure out how long the visa is valid for. Below is the code we can use to implement these two steps.</p>
      <code>
          <div id="html">
            afaan_visa = visa_application.new(06875467360627)<br>
            p afaan_visa.visa_duration<br>
            => 06<br>
            <i># A 6 month visa duration was returned for my visa application number</i>
          </div>
        </code>
        <p>The power of using classes is that from this point, we could add more and more instance methods to the visa_applciation class to read-in, calculate, create, and return more relevant data about the visa application. This is of course why I am so flustered by how long it is taking for me to get my visa processed and my passport returned to me. The nice thing though is that this blog took a pretty long time too, and it looks like my passport has been delivered since I started writing it!
