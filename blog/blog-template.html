Wireframing was perhaps the most fun challenge yet! It was so interesting to see the various tools out there, and play around with them a bit. I am not good a sketching and so I relied on one of these tools (balsamiq) while my pair was a relatively good sketcher and he preferred to draw by hand, which was a nice compliment.

I found wireframing to be very helpful to the development process. It give me a visual udnerstanding of how the <h> tags work. It is not about size, but about relative importance. I knew that, but only when I started wireframing did I really understand what that meant. I also got thinking about how to create vertical and horizontal sections on a page, and if there are tags or similar in html that could help with that. The <hr /> tag was one such basic example that I amd glad I found and ended up using in my template.

My pair and I decided that a good wireframe is one that is simple, intuitive, and quick. Yes, quick. We caught oursleves a few times getting into the "styling" territory and upon realizing this we reminded ourselves of the purpose of wireframing and quickly checked whether thestructure and hierarchy of information was conveyed, and then moved on.

In addition to the use of the <hr /> tag, I learned that a series of buttons could be accomplished by a series of nested <a> tags. I was inclined to use a table without borders to keep it tidy, but again reminded myself that CSS is probably better suited for that. Finally, I used image/thumbnails as the bullets to a list of links instead of an ordered or unordered list.
